<p>The goals of this study are to create opportunities for enriching the family interaction and collaboratively collecting family stories among family members. We present PicMemory, an interactive mobile application for bridging the gaps of technology familiar between the older and the younger generations in the intergenerational family. We purpose three functions: (1) Multi-model story collection; (2) Collaborative memory organization; and (3) Enriched family interaction, to facilitate the communication and memory collection within the family. In this demonstration, we extend the concepts of enriching conference experience by collecting participants' feedback and organizing the memories of the conference. We are looking forward to seeing the PicMemory can be used to interact with all participants, and willing to hearing about any interesting user experiences. Meanwhile, we will collect user feedback to inform our future directions of the PicMemory.</p>
